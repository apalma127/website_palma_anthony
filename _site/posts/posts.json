I assumed, as there are many other nationality drivers, that it was more of a European centered sport. I chose to look at American wins over the years as I was curious to see how well American drivers have performed in a sport that I think is not super well known in America. As I suspected, I would guess it is not as well knwon possibly because of the trend seen above. With little American success (actually 0 wins since a bit before 1980), if someone wasnâ€™t an avid fan they most likely would not know much as opposed to more American-centric sports like football.\nWeek 2: Billboard Top Hits\n\nI have heard of many songs going on and off the billboard top hits list. I was curious as to how the speed to the top of the list is different for songs that only were popular for one stint compared to songs that went on and off the list many times, specifically on and off a lot of times. As you can see, songs that are big hits one time only (ie on and off the list, not on and off several times) saw a very quick and steep rise to the top of the list (denoted by a steep slope down w massive y axis scale). As the instance of the song increases, you can see less of a skew on the graph as opposed to the instance == 1 sharp right skew, denoting less of a rise beyond its initial instance. Notice the free y axis scales and how even steeper rises to the top of the list (bottom of y axis) for increased instances does not compare in any way to the massive and exponential rise to the top of the list for instance == 1. In summary, songs that are one hit wonders on the list skyrocket to the top with increased weeks on the chart resulting in higher peak position. Songs that have been on the list already tend to start a bit higher on the list in its initial peak position yet as weeks go on, the rise to the top is wayyyyyy less drastic / evident (or even existent).\n\n\n\n",
